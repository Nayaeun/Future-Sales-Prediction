# Future-Sales-Prediction

## Introduction
In the realm of forecasting vital for finance, sales, and logistics, this project centers on the strategic application of time series analysis to predict future trends. Operating on a dataset marked by inherent seasonality, the project employs a spectrum of forecasting modelsâ€”ranging from fundamental, like Holt-Winters, to sophisticated, such as ARIMA and SARIMA. Evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error, AIC, and BIC guide model assessment. Preceding modeling, diligent preprocessing unfolds with stationarity testing, differencing, and adept feature selection. The overarching aim is to pinpoint the model adept at capturing dataset nuances and delivering precise forecasts. This project's outcomes promise valuable insights into the nuanced world of time series analysis and the pivotal considerations in model selection.
